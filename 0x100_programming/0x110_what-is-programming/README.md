## 0x110 What is programming?

**Programming** is a series of instructions or statements written in a specific language. In terms of computer programming, it needs to converting it into a **machine language**, that consists of raw bits and bytes and it varies from architecture-to-architecture (i.e. Intel x86 or x86-x64). To communicate with a computer, the programming needs to be translated using **low-level** **assembler**, which is a program that translates **assembly language** into a machine code. Aside of the assembler, programming can also be translated with more **high-level** **compiler** to convert it into machine language.

An example of typical program for driving directions might look like this.

Start out down Main Street headed east. Continue on Main Street until you see a church on your right. If the street is blocked because of construction, turn right there at 15th Street, turn left on Pine Street, and then turn right on 16th Street. Otherwise, you can just continue and make a right on 16th Street. Continue on 16th Street, and turn left onto Destination Road. Drive straight down Destination Road for 5 miles, and then you'll see the house on the right. The address is 743 Destination Road.
