## 0x120 Pseudo-code

Programmers write the idea from the English language into arranged general structure that similar to high-level programming languages (often like C), is known as **pseudo-code**. 

The following pseudo-code is somewhat translated from the typical program above.

```
Begin going East on Main Street;
While (there is not a church on the right)
	Drive down Main Street;
If (street is blocked)
{
	Turn right on 15th Street;
	Turn left on Pine Street;
	Turn right on 16th Street;
}
Else
	Turn right on 16th Street;
Turn left on Destination Road;
For (ctr=0; ctr<5; ctr++)
	Drive straight for 1 mile;
Stop at 743 Destination Road;
```
