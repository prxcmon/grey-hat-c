This repository, which is from my Notes section, is my personal learning guide based on the book “Hacking: The Art of Exploitation (2nd Edition) by Jon Erickson”, which contains heavily reproduced steps that I am currently learning. This repository will contain more external projects that I will make based on the influence or reproduction of other learners’ projects from the aforementioned source.
